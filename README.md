# Final Project

In this branch you find all the necessary to complete your final project.

The branch is named after the group of students a given project is assigned to. The name is left generic, "GroupN", on purpose, the actual group members are listed in the `Members.txt` file.

Students are supposed to work together to produce a short report on the assigned task, which will have to be committed to the group branch together with the code developed to achieve the results. The preferred format for the latter is a (properly commented) jupyter notebook. Further information about the deliverables are given in the project instructions.

The following files are there for reference:

* `Members.txt` the list of students belonging to the group

* `CloudInstructions.md` It contains the instruction to set-up and utilise the [CloudVeneto](http://cloudveneto.it/) computing resources

* `Project.ipynb` the actual description of the assigned project
